# Spring boot related features

Celeritas offers features that integrate with your spring boot applications.
Celeritas `SB2` versions support spring boot version `2.x` and `SB3` versions support spring boot version `3.x`.
But if you don't use Spring boot, no worries, you can always use Celeritas and select any version.

## The SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository repository base class

The main purpose of the SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository class is to allow you to solve the `HHH000104` firstResult maxResults warning using Spring Data JPA
Specification and Criteria API. Indeed, whenever you use pagination and SQL joins to fetch entities and their associations to prevent the N+1 queries problem,
you'll most-likely run into the Hibernate's `HHH000104` warning message.

:sos: _**Be aware that this alert is very bad for your application, and especially for its performance when your dataset grows.**_

The SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository class implements the solution to this problem that was proposed by the excellent Vlad Mihalcea
in [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/fix-hibernate-hhh000104-entity-fetch-pagination-warning-message/).

### How to use SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository ?

To use SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository only a few steps are required. First, you need to add this configuration to your Spring Boot application :

```java
@EnableJpaRepositories(repositoryBaseClass = SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository.class)
```

Then make your repository extends CeleritasJpaSpecificationExecutor and override the findAll method to use an `@EntityGraph` :

```java

@Repository
public interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<EntityClass, Long>, CeleritasJpaSpecificationExecutor<EntityClass, Long> {

  @Override
  @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "yourJoinAttribute")
  List<EntityClass> findAll(Specification<EntityClass> spec);
}

//Or more quickly using the Celeritas GenericRepository
@Repository
public interface MyRepository extends GenericRepository<EntityClass, Long> {

  @Override
  @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "yourJoinAttribute")
  List<EntityClass> findAll(Specification<EntityClass> spec);
}
```

Then you simply call the `findAllEntitiesIds()` method from your own repositories, which will return the IDs of the entities matching your search.
Once you have retrieved the ids of your entities, create a new JPA specification using the `idIn()` method.

```java
// Please note that the specification can be null here
Page<Long> myEntitiesIdsPage = myRepository.findAllEntitiesIds(specification,pageable);

List<EntityClass> result;
List<Long> ids = myEntitiesIdsPage.getContent();

if (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(ids)) {
  result = Collections.emptyList();
} else {
  // Retrieve entities using IN predicate
  Specification<EntityClass> idInSpecification = myRepository.idIn(ids, "myEntityIdAttributeName");
  result = myRepository.findAll(idInSpecification);
}

return PageableExecutionUtils
    .getPage(result, pageable, ()-> myEntitiesIdsPage.getTotalElements());
```

With this approach, you effectively eliminate the performance problem caused by paging in your application memory by relaying it to your database.

### Conclusion on the Hibernate `HHH000104` warning

The `HHH000104` warning is so bad. There is no SQL pagination because the pagination is done in the application memory. Imagine that your query retrieves 1 or 2
million elements from your database without pagination in the SQL query actually sent : you then load the 1 or 2 million elements into your application and
return only a small part to the caller... **This is counterproductive !**

There a couple of approaches to fix the pagination in memory. One of them is to execute two SQL queries. The first query retrieves just the entitiesâ€™ ID
using pagination and the second query retrieves the entities using an IN predicate with the IDs from the first query. This is the solution offered by Celeritas
with SimpleCeleritasJpaRepository.
